# Product Hunt-like Comments Feature

This update adds a full-fledged Product Hunt-like experience to the Dualite Showcase platform with commenting functionality.

## New Features

### 1. Project Detail Page
- **Route**: `/projects/:projectId`
- **Features**:
  - Full project overview with large screenshot
  - Project description and metadata
  - Upvote functionality
  - "Visit Site" button to go to the actual website
  - Comments section with nested replies

### 2. Updated Project Cards
- **Two Action Buttons**:
  - **"Visit Site"**: Opens the project URL in a new tab
  - **"View Project"**: Navigates to the detailed project page with comments

### 3. Comments System
- **Features**:
  - Add comments to any project
  - Reply to existing comments (nested replies)
  - Edit your own comments
  - Delete your own comments
  - Real-time comment count display
  - Timestamp formatting (e.g., "2h ago", "3d ago")

## Database Schema

### Comments Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.comments (
    id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    project_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    parent_id uuid REFERENCES public.comments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    content text NOT NULL,
    created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
    updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
);
```

### Key Features:
- **Nested Replies**: Comments can have parent comments for threaded discussions
- **Cascade Deletion**: Comments are deleted when users or projects are deleted
- **Automatic Timestamps**: `updated_at` is automatically updated when comments are edited
- **Row Level Security**: Users can only edit/delete their own comments

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration
Run the new migration file in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Run the contents of: supabase/migrations/add_comments_table.sql
```

### 2. Frontend Updates
The following files have been updated:
- `frontend/src/pages/ProjectDetailPage.tsx` (new file)
- `frontend/src/pages/ProjectsPage.tsx` (updated with new buttons)
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` (added new route)
- `frontend/src/lib/supabase.ts` (added Comment type)
- `frontend/src/vite-env.d.ts` (fixed TypeScript issues)

### 3. TypeScript Types
New Comment type added:
```typescript
export type Comment = {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  project_id: string;
  parent_id?: string;
  content: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
  user_email?: string;
  replies?: Comment[];
};
```

## User Experience

### Project Cards (Projects Page)
- Each project card now has two distinct action buttons
- "Visit Site" with external link icon
- "View Project" with message icon for comments
- Upvote button remains in the top-right

### Project Detail Page
- **Header Section**:
  - Large project screenshot
  - Project title and creator info
  - Creation date
  - Full description
  - Upvote button (disabled for own projects)
  - "Visit Site" button

- **Comments Section**:
  - Comment count in header
  - Add comment form (for logged-in users)
  - Threaded comments with replies
  - Edit/delete options for own comments
  - Reply functionality for all users

## Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)

- **Update Access**: Users can only edit their own comments

### Data Validation
